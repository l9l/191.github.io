    <td>In that lesson I learnt why I could not change my background image. This was because I did not have a ; after a : which completes a piece of code, like a sentence being completed with a full stop. However there is still a problem with the vlookup on my google sheet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited because I was stuck with the google sheet. Every time I tried to type an item under the category "item" it kept giving me an invalid code sign, or , it will only give the option of some of the items instead of all of them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will ask Mr Tansley about the problem and see if I can get it to work.</td>
