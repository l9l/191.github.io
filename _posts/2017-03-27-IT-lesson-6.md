    <td>I learnt by reading the manual and fitting in the components into the fuzebox and typing out the appropriate code so that the 5 LED lights would light up in a flashing pattern. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the amount of time it took for me and my partner to insert the cables LED lights and restrictors into the fuzebox.  We only managed to complete one part of the manual in the time we had available.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work faster to place in the electronic components so that I have more time to do other exercises from the manual. </td>
