    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by placing the plug of the robotic arm into the USB port of the fuzebox  and typing out the appropriate code so that when I pressed a certain number a certain part of the arm moved or reacted to the command.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the amount of time we took experimenting with the controls for the robot and filming it.  Once I have learnt these controls by heart, I will be quicker.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will progress further into the stages of the robotic arm and try to be more accustomed to using it.  </td>
