    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading from the manual and then typing up the code into Fuzebox. This strategy was effective because it helped me explore Fuzebox and its many uses. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the small amount of coding I knew however I learnt things from the lesson for instance the command CLS will clear the screen. I need to work on how fast I type and my knowledge of IT.
</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will research coding techniques and languages so that I can bring a bit more knowledge to my IT lessons. This will also improve my learning.</td>
