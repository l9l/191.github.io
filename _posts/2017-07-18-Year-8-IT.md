YEAR 8 IT

In year 8 we learnt about the fuzebox and how to make flashing lights, make a robot arm move and many other things. We also filmed some of it and put it on our blogs. This was a very interesting and involving topic.  

The next project was python by using codecademy. We learnt about strings,lists,dictionaries,conditionals and much more. The progress I personally made was 52%. This topic was very useful in what our lives could become, so if we wanted to go into graphics and IT , this would help us out a lot.

In conclusion year 8 IT was very interesting and informative and has paved the way for me to develop my understanding of IT and coding.
