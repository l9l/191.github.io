    <td>The strategy was the same as all of my other lessons. I read the text describing what I was learning and then carried out the exercise.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was not limited so much today. In fact I worked very efficiently. My learning was only limited by the fact that I forgot a lot about lists the day before when I was doing some homework. </td>
