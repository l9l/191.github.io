    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by adapting methods used in the booklet. This strategy was effective because it not only made me learn but also let me use my imagination to a greater degree. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that I had so much code to type out and my typing speed is slow and so a lot of my time was taken up doing this. I need to speed up my typing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could improve my learning by skipping one or two parts of the manual so that I get closer to reaching my goal...using a robotic arm.</td>
